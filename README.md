# Customer Churn Prediction with Artificial Neural Networks

This repository contains a comprehensive project aimed at predicting customer churn using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Customer churn refers to the loss of customers or clients, and predicting it can help businesses retain customers and enhance their services.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model using ANN to identify customers at risk of leaving the company, enabling proactive retention strategies and optimizing marketing efforts.

### Key Features

- **Data Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis to understand customer behavior and identify patterns that lead to churn.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for modeling, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Artificial Neural Networks**: Design and implementation of an ANN model using Keras and TensorFlow to predict customer churn.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.


### Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains customer information and churn status. It includes features such as customer demographics, account information, and usage patterns.
